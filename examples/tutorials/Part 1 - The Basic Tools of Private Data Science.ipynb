    "# Tutorial: Private Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to PySyft's introductory tutorial for privacy preserving deep learning. This series of notebooks is a step-by-step guide for you to get to know the new tools and techniques required for doing deep learning on secret data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Take This Tutorial?\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) A Competitive Career Advantage** - For the past 20 years, the digital revolution has made data more and more accessible in ever larger quantities as analog processes have become digitized. However, with new regulation such as [GDPR](https://eugdpr.org/), enterprises are under pressure to have less freedom with how they use - and more importantly how they analyze - personal information. **Bottom Line:** Data Scientists aren't going to have access to as much data with \"old school\" tools, but by learning the tools of Private Deep Learning, YOU can be ahead of this curve and have a competitive advantage in you career. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Entrepreneurial Opportunities** - There are a whole host of problems in society that Deep Learning can solve, but many of the most important haven't been explored because it would require access to incredibly sensitive information about people (consider using Deep Learning to help people with mental or relationship issues!). Thus, learning Private Deep Learning unlocks a whole host of new startup opportunities for you which were not previously available to others without these toolsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Social Good** - Deep Learning can be used to solve a wide variety of problems in the real world, but Deep Learning on *personal information* is Deep Learning about people, *for people*. Learning how to do Deep Learning on data you don't own represents more than a career or entrepreneurial opportunity, it is the opportunity to help solve some of the most personal and important problems in people's lives - and to do it at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What do I need to know?\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Deep Learning with PyTorch** - if you don't just hop on over to [fast.ai](https://fast.ai), learn Deep Learning and PyTorch, and come back here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do I get extra credit?\n",
    "\n",
